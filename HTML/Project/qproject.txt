For this project you should:

1. Find a resource online that gives you a list of each HTML tag that you can use.
2. Pick 5 of those tags (5 that we have not covered so far).
3. Create a simple website about your favorite book / story, and include those 5 tags in the HTML. (The page can have any other tags as well, as long as those 5 are included). 
   This can take any form. You can get as complicated or as simple as you wish.
4. Add comments to each section of your code, explaining the purpose of that block.

For extra credit, use one or more of these tags (if you haven't already):

1. <video>
2. <audio>
3. <form>
4. <select>
5. <input>
6. <base>
7. <meta> 
8. <iframe>

Part 3: Share Your Work and Teach Others [REQUIRED]

It's time to share your work with the world, and teach others what you learned. Write up a short explanation (1-2 paragraphs) of the code you created. 
Explain what you learned in the course so far, and then explain how your code works.

Then, take your explanation and create a post online that shares your code and the writeup. 
This could be any of the options below:

Pick one of these options only:

1. A blog post / Medium post
2. A reddit post
3. A tweet
4. An instagram post or story
5. A facebook post or story
6. A LinkedIn post
7. A youtube video / screenshare
8. A facebook video / screenshare
9. A Snapchat or Tiktok video

Pick the option that works for you. Get creative! Once you're done, take screenshots of the post/video you created.
Note: Creating a post in our Student Forum does not count, as the purpose of the assignment is to teach the public, not our current students.
