It's time to make your recipe (from homework #1) a little more exciting.

1. Add a title to your page (within the <head>) and an actual <h1> title on the page.
2. Below the h1, add a paragraph that explains what the food is, and why you like it so much.
3. Somewhere on the page, add a few images of finished versions of your dish so that the reader can see what the final product should look like.
4. Add emojis to your second list (the ordered list), so that at least 5 of the lines end with an emoji character. You can find emojis online pretty easily. 
If you don't how to use emojis in HTML, read this article. Then use this reference.
